## **DESCRIPTION**

---

FinCloud is a fresh way to manage money. It provides all the financial services in one place including expense tracking,budget planning, credit monitoring, taxing filling and investment trakcer. The expense tracker aims to assist a user in managing personal finances by offering not only a basic expense check but also a brief analysis of incomes and expenses.

The project is a MERN stack application, deployed on Heroku. The front-end is developed in CSS and React.js while the back-end is created in Express and Node.js. The data is stored in MongoDB Atlas. Then, a user can perform CRUD operations through this API such as create, read, update, and delete data.

## **USER STORY**

---

- Add/ Edit/ Delete a transaction: The user can create a new income or expense transaction which can be deleted or modified after the creation.

- Check recent transactions: The user will see all transactions took place in the last three days and the sum of income, expense and balance in the personal dashboard.

- Check history transactions: The user can also check the list of previous transactions along with the sum and ratio of income and expense in a month.

- Get an overview of incomes and expenses: All transactions of the user are accumulated to the daily, weekly and monthly total sum and visualized as a histogram. The user then gets a better understanding of the weekly, monthly and yearly fluctuation of incomes and expenses.
