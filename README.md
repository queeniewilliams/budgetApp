The expense tracker aims to assist a user in managing personal finances by offering not only a basic expense check but also a brief analysis of incomes and expenses.

The project is a MERN stack application, deployed on Heroku. The front-end is developed in CSS and React.js while the back-end is created in Express and Node.js. The data is stored in MongoDB Atlas. Then, a user can perform CRUD operations through this API such as create, read, update, and delete data.

- Add/ Edit/ Delete a transaction: The user can create a new income or expense transaction which can be deleted or modified after the creation.

- Check recent transactions: The user will see all transactions took place in the last three days and the sum of income, expense and balance in the personal dashboard.

- Check history transactions: The user can also check the list of previous transactions along with the sum and ratio of income and expense in a month.

- Get an overview of incomes and expenses: All transactions of the user are accumulated to the daily, weekly and monthly total sum and visualized as a histogram. The user then gets a better understanding of the weekly, monthly and yearly fluctuation of incomes and expenses.
